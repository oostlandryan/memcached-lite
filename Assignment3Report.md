# Memcache-Lite

## Running the Server and Client on Google Compute Engine
A bash script, [gcpdeployment.sh](gcpdeployment.sh), starts the server and client instances in the PROJECTNAME project using gcloud. It then uses `gcloud compute ssh` to access the instances, clone the git repo containing my memcached-lite code, install Go, and finally run the programs. Memcached-lite outputs are wrapped in dashes and should be easy to read in the terminal. After the programs have ran, the server and client instances are deleted.
## Known Issues
Sometimes `gcloud compute ssh` fails with error 255. This is a known issue with gcloud. The easiest fix seems to be to delete the ssh keys associated with the project through the gcp console. Other suggested fixes include calling `gcloud compute config-ssh` or adding a new firewall rule to allow ssh on port 22 \(this didn't work for me as it said I already had that rule\). This might just be an issue with my project and is never an issue the first time the script is ran. Additionally, I accidentally added my $50 credit to my person Google account, not my IU account. As a result I have not had the VCP issues that I've heard other students have. This script therefore assumes that the project is configured with Google's default network settings.
